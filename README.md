* Lectures will cover the major topics, emphasizing and discussing the important points, and programming examples in tutorials. 
* Tutorials are intended to support your understanding . Examples in lecture slides 
* Programming labs
* Homework assignments are 

At the end of the course, students should be able to use MATLAB in their own work, and be prepared to deepen their MATLAB programming skills and tackle other languages for computing, such as Java, C++, or Python.

Helps you understand the role that MATLAB can play in reducing the overall complexity of math and in experlaining math-relatied information to others more easily. 


Variables, arrays, conditional statements, loops, functions, and plots are covered in a project-based style where much of the learning happens away from the classroom. Students are expected to spend about 4 hours per week on homework. 

This course teaches computer programming to those with little to no previous experience. It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market.

Nevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.

Students taking the course will get a MATLAB Online license free of charge for the duration of the course. The students are encouraged to consult the eBook that this course is based on. More information about these resources can be found on the Resources menu on the right.


## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students should be able to  
* Define your problems with programmable logic in MATLAB 
* Compose working, efficient, and readable code in various ways
* Debug your code to identify and fix programming errors
* Identify suitable keywords for searching for solutions on the web
* Solve mathematical and engineering problems through MATLAB programming

### Tip 1: How to improve your programming skills 
Step 1. Make your program working without error by all means
Step 2. Understand a model answer (e.g. program logic, useful built-in functions, programming styles)
Step 3. Consider how to modify/improve your own programs
Step 4. Re-write your program from the scratch without copying solutions

### Tip 2: How to complete the course with over 90 
* Review lecture slides and tutorials before attending programming labs

## Programming Labs 
There will be ten programming labs and nine lab assignments. The assignments are designed to help understanding of course materials as well as build programming capability. Students are supposed to complete all tasks and turn their works **by the end of the lab (11:30 am)**. The instructor and two TAs will help complete the task within each lab session. Attendance in the labs is not mandatory, but students who do not attend/are absent from the labs for any reason must submit the lab assignment **before the lab starts (9:30 am)**. No late submission is accepted for those who do not attend the labs (TA will check your submission time). In each lab, the TA will assign your new partner to solve the problem together.

## Homework Assignments 
Students should be encouraged to work in groups through collaborative learning, but to submit their assignments individually. Students must not share their solutions to other students. The TA will run a software to check the similarity of your code for detecting plagiarism. Please do not think you may be able to deceive graders. Although you pass all problems in a MATLAB grader, you fail the assignments. Each homework will be opened for solving on Saturday night and must be submitted before a Monday class on the following week. After due data and time, homework assignment in online will be closed and you are not able to submit your works. 
No late submission is accepted and any missed homowork will be given a 0 grade. Thus, students must inform the TA in advance with an email or at the office hour if you have a valid excuse.

### Turnitin.com
Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>

## Supplement

### Discussion forum instruction
- To post questions or comments, students should make their own Github account. **Students do not have to make their accounts using school emails if they already have accounts or they want anonymity.**
- Please be respectful of your peers, instructor, and others in your posts and comments.
- Asking good questions is another way of learning by summarizing and explaining what you know and do not know. Thoughtful questions and answers will help all students in this class. Before posting a question, please ask yourself whether you are truly stuck (meaning that the answers can be readily found on the web) and your question are complete and legible. 
- In addition, please check if the same question was asked before.   
- When students write a post on the *Issues* board, the instructor or CA will assign an appropriate label among "Task", "Class", "Project", "Resource", and "Suggestion".  
- Inappropriate posts and comments are immediately deleted and closed without a notice.
